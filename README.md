## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the app using your preferred method (HTTPS, SSH, GitHub CLI)
2. Open up the project in an IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Cursor etc.)
3. In the terminal, run `npm install` to install the relevant dependencies for the project
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. Any changes that you make to the code while the server is running will immediately be reflected on the web page after you save the code & reload the page

## Features

The boilerplate code that was given to us allowed users to:

- View all posts in the database
- Create a new post and add it to the database
- Edit existing posts
- Delete existing posts

We also added the ability for users to search for existing posts and sort existing posts with a selection of predefined filters.

We also added the ability for people to register or log in to an account which is securely saved to the database.

We also added a user profile pages where users can change their profile picture, edit their name or email, change their password and even permanently delete their account.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the challenges that we faced was the implementation of session tokens. [talk about the problem and what you did to fix it]

# Evidence for Marking Criteria

- explain how each thing in the marking criteria was addressed
- Reference relevant sections of the codebase or configuration
  files.
- Provide additional evidence (e.g., videos, screenshots, or links)
  as required.

## Feature Implementation

video goes here
code examples of:

- registering a user & then logging in seperately to show both functionality
- searching/sorting posts
- editing and deleting posts, also show how you can't edit posts that aren't yours
- editing a user's profile (change password, edit details, delete account, profile picture)
- **It says to reference key sections of the codebase, I can add those to be side-by-side in the video**

## Testing

### Test Approach

We decided not to follow a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach because we were still in the process of defining the application's scope and determining which features to prioritise. Without a clear roadmap of all the functionalities, writing precise tests before implementation felt impractical.

Instead, we adopted BDD (Behaviour Driven Development), which allowed us to write tests based on how the application should behave from a user's perspective. This approach provided us the flexibility to iterate on features while still ensuring that the core functionalities met our expectations.

Our tests are structured to validate the application's behavior, as seen in the example below:

```javascript
describe("GET /", () => {
  it("should ..test scenario", async () => {});
});
```

With this format, we validate both the HTTP response status and the presence of key elements on the page, ensuring that the user experience aligns with our expectations. By using BDD, we were able to remain adaptable while still maintaining confidence in our application's functionality.

### How edge cases and error conditions were tested

The primary way in which edge cases were identified was through carefully thinking about how potential users of the app would use it. Across the website, there are places where input forms are used - users could potentially enter nothing into the input fields and potentially risk sending bad requests to modify the database. To reduce the risk of this, we modified the input field component to not accept blank inputs and force the user to input text before submitting the form.

## Security Enhancements

### Input Validation

### CSRF Protection

### Safeguards against XSS and SQL injection

### Password Hashing

We decided not to encrypt passwords as it relies on an encryption key to decrypt the data back into its original form. Even if we store this key securely in environment variables, there's still a risk: if someone gains access to the key, they could decrypt and expose all stored passwords.

We decided to hash the passwords using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs). Hashing is a one-way operation, meaning once a password is hashed, it cannot be reversed back to its original form.
When users register, their password is hashed and stored in the database. During login, the input password is hashed again and compared to the stored hash, ensuring the original password is never stored or exposed.

However, even hashing can cause hash collisions. If two users set the same password, they would have the same hash. Additionally, precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) exist online for common passwords, making it easier for attackers to crack weak hashes.

To address this limitation, we added salting to our password hashing process. Each password is hashed with a unique, random salt, ensuring even identical passwords produce unique hashes, effectively preventing rainbow table attacks.

#### Implementation Details

**Registration**: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt using a salt round of 10
`(bcrypt.hash(password, 10))`
before being stored.

**Login**: User-entered passwords are compared securely using bcrypt.compare, ensuring the plain text password never touches our database.

#### Example picture of database where password entered was 123 and it shows the hashed password

![image of the database showing a users password being hashed](/public/resources/readme-assets/exampledatabasehashing.png)

By using hashing with salting, we've significantly enhanced our password security. Usersâ€™ credentials are better protected against common attacks like rainbow table lookups and hash collisions, ensuring that their sensitive information remains confidential even in the event of a database breach.

### CSRF Protection

### Input Validation
**Input Sanitisation**
We sanitise inputs by using the [validator library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) to ensure that the inputs are well-formed. For example, we check if the email follows a valid format and if passwords are long enough. This ensures that malicious or unexpected input, such as special characters that might be used for injection (e.g., `--` `;` ` ` ), doesn't get submitted in the first place.

For example, the validation checks that:

```javascript
if (!validator.isEmail(email)) {
  return res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: "Invalid email format." });
}
```

If an attacker tries to input something like `DROP TABLE users;`, this won't pass the `isEmail()` validation check and will be rejected.

### CSRF Protection

### Safeguards against XSS

### Safeguards against SQL injection
While Sequelize's ORM handles SQL injection prevention automatically, we further strengthened the app's security through different methods.

**Trim Input Values**
We trim the input values (e.g., `name.trim()`, `email.trim()`), which helps remove leading and trailing spaces. This reduces the risk of injecting characters that could be used for SQL injection

**Limit the amount of data being retrieved from the database**
We added an attributes option in the Sequelize queries to limit the amount of data being retrieved from the database.

When querying a database using Sequelize, by default, all fields of the matching records are returned unless you specify otherwise. Since most of the time, we only need specific fields (e.g., id, password), we now request only the necessary fields using the attributes option. This helps reduce the amount of data being transferred from the database and can improve performance, especially when dealing with large tables.
For example, when checking if an email is already registered, we only need the id to know whether the user exists or not.

```javascript
const existingUser = await User.findOne({
  where: { email },
  attributes: ["id"], 
});
```

By limiting the fields retrieved to just what's necessary (id, password), we reduce the amount of data fetched from the database, improving performance.

Restricting the data selected prevents unnecessary exposure of sensitive information. For example, we don't need to retrieve the user's name or email when we're just checking if a user exists or verifying their password.



### Any additional configurations or tools used

## Code Quality and Refactoring

### Sections of the code demonstrating modularisation

### Key improvements made during refactoring

For the Profile page, initially all of the test suites were held within one file, although separated by distinct describe blocks. However, it was getting difficult to work on the file because of the amount of unrelated tests. As a solution, we decided to split up the tests into their individual functionalities (edit details, delete account etc.)

![alt text](/public/resources/readme-assets/profile-tests.png)

This made the tests much easier to work with, because there was a 'separation of concerns' between the various test files.

![alt text](/public/resources/readme-assets/pug-folder.png)

We also refactored the views folder containing the `.pug` files, because as we added new page views, it became more difficult to find a particular file. Each `.pug` file is now categorised into being under either **blog-posts** or **user-profile**, this made it a lot easier for us to find the file that we were looking for while developing.

###

## CI/CD and Git Practices

### GitHub Actions Used

After a pull request had been made, we added a couple of GitHub actions to our repository for both linting and testing our code.

![alt text](/public/resources/readme-assets/pr-checks.png)

#### Linting Code

To maintain consistent code standards and ensure our codebase remains clean and tidy, we implemented a GitHub Action specifically for linting. For this, we used ESLint along with a custom configuration file tailored to our project requirements.

The linting action is triggered automatically on both pull requests and direct pushes to the master branch, helping to catch issues early and streamline the code review process.
We opted for ESLint due to its flexibility and wide adoption within the JavaScript ecosystem.

#### Testing

We streamlined the CI process by automating functionality tests. This workflow triggers whenever changes are pushed or when pull requests are created. This provides rapid feedback on code changes, allowing us to catch errors early and fix them before they reach production. This in turn reduces manual effort and human error, as every change is thoroughly tested without requiring developer intervention. It also ensures consistent testing environments and accelerates the development workflow by integrating caching mechanisms for dependencies to improve efficiency.

### How we colllaborated

To collaborate on the code that we individually worked on, we used PRs (pull requests) as a means to verify each other's code before it had been merged into the main branch. This process would start once somebody had pushed changes to their branch such that they had added implementation and the necessary tests. Once they had created a pull request on GitHub and added a relevant description to their PR, they would share this PR with the rest of the team via Slack, which is the primary messaging tool that we use at work.

After the PR had completed the necessary checks, the person who made the PR would merge their branch into the `main` branch using GitHub's `Rebase and merge` button.
